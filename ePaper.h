  This program is to illustrate the display operation as described in
  the datasheets.  The code is in a simple linear fashion and all the
  delays are set to maximum, but the SPI clock is set lower than its
  limit.  Therfore the display sequence will be much slower than
  normal and all of the individual display stages be clearly visible.
